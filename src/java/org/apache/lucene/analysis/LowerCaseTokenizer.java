/** LowerCaseTokenizer performs the function of LetterTokenizer
  and LowerCaseFilter together.  It divides text at non-letters and converts
  them to lower case.  While it is functionally equivalent to the combination
  of LetterTokenizer and LowerCaseFilter, there is a performance advantage
  to doing the two tasks at once, hence this (redundent) implementation.

  Note: this does a decent job for most European languages, but does a terrible
  job for some Asian languages, where words are not separated by spaces. */
